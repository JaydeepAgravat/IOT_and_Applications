## Microcontroller

- Microcontroller is a digital device consisting of CPU, peripheral I/Os, memories, interrupts, etc. in
a single chip or IC.
- Microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed for a specific operation in an embedded
system.

## Sensors and Their Interfacing

- A sensor is a device that measures physical input from its environment and converts it into data
that can be interpreted by either a human or a machine.
- The sensors are input devices and there are two types of sensors.
    1. Analog Sensors
    2. Digital Sensors
