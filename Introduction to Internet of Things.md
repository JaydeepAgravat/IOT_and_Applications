## Introduction to IOT

- Internet is  Network of Networks or Interconnected LANs.
- IoT is network of interconnected computing devices which are embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.
- IoT devices exchange meaningful information from one device to another device to get the desire result.
- IoT is not a single technology, it’s a combination of technologies and domain knowledge.
- As a result, engineers from different domains have to work together for building a complete IoT
product.

## Application of IOT

- The scope and application areas of IoT is very huge.
- IoT can be used to build applications for

1. Agriculture
2. Assets Tracking
3. Energy Sector
4. Defense
5. Embedded Applications
6. Education
7. Waste Management
8. Healthcare Products
9. Telemedicine
10. Safety And Security Sector
11. Smart City Applications

## Characteristics of IOT

1. Connectivity
2. Identity
3. Intelligence
4. Scalability
5. Dynamic and self-adapting (complexity)
6. Architecture
7. Safety

## Things in IOT

- In the IoT, things refer to a variety of devices. It can be anything even humans in it become a
thing.
- For something to qualify as a “thing”, it requires identity of its existence.
- The devices having all the below characteristics are known as things.

1. The “thing” in a network can be monitored/measure. For example, a temperature sensor could be a thing.
2. Things are capable of exchanging data with other connected devices in the system.
3. The data could be stored in a centralized server (or cloud), processed there and a control action could be initiated.

## IOT Stack

- Following are the identified seven layers in IoT stack.

1. Layer 1 (Physical or Sensor Layer)
2. Layer 2 (Processing and Control Action layer)
3. Layer 3 (Hardware Interface Layer)
4. Layer 4 (RF Layer)
5. Layer 5 (Session/Message Layer)
6. Layer 6 (User Experience Layer)
7. Layer 7 (Application Layer)

## Enabling Technologies

- IoT is a collection or group of many technologies and devices.

1. Sensors
2. Cloud Computing
3. Big Data Analytics
4. Embedded Computing Boards
5. Communication Protocols
6. User Interfaces

## IOT Challenges

- The following are some of the challenges - technical and non-technical during building an IoT application.

1. Security/Personnel safety
2. Privecy
3. Data extraction with consistency from complex environments
4. Connectivity
5. Power requirements
6. Complexity involved
7. Storage

## IOT Levels

- Based on the architectural approach, IoT can be classified in five levels: Level 1 to Level 5.

1. Level 1
    - Home automation, a few home appliances, and lights
2. Level 2
    - Smart irrigation
3. Lelvel 3
    - Package monitoring in a distribution system
4. Lelvel 4
    - Noise monitoring device
5. Lelvel 5
    - Forest Fire Detection System example

## Cyber Physical System vs IOT

|                                Cyber-Physical System(CPS)                                |                                            Internet of things (IoT)                                           |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| The CPS system is to monitor and controls physical processes in a seamless manner.       | IoT is create a network of interconnected devices to collect and exchange data.                               |
| It is an integration of physics with cyber Components networked which is interconnected. | It contains all physical devices primarily created terms that are connected to the controls Sensors internet. |
| CPS systems are more complex compared then IoT devices.                                  | IoT systems are relatively simple.                                                                            |
| CPS devices are designed to interact with physical processes and control them.           | IoT devices are primarily created compared to interact with data-centric.                                     |
| CPS is using Sensors and Actuators to work in the feedback loop.                         | IoT is pure automation it does not need any external things.                                                  |
| It needs human intervention and human-to-computer intervention.                          | it doesn’t need any human assistance.                                                                         |
| Cyber + Physics(Physical devices(world) = CPS (Cyber Physical System)                    | Internet (connectivity)  + Things (IoT devices) = IoT (internet of things)                                    |
| Examples are smart homes, industrial control systems, and wearable devices.              | Examples are Electronic vehicles and home appliances.                                                         |

## Wireless Sensor Network vs IOT

| Architecture | IOT has a gateway that can connect to internetworks (having routers, switches, APs, etc.).   | WSN consists of a network of only sensors                         |
| Devices      | IOT runs IPv6 in the sensor network (802.15.4 MAC/PHY) and IPv4 on the internetwork portion. | WSN runs IPv4 and features a sink (not a gateway)                 |
| Protocols    | Routing protocols in NetSim IoT include AODV and RPL.                                        | Routing protocols in NetSim WSN include DSR, AODV, OLSR, and ZRP. |
